### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I have a pretty good experience with Java, ðŸŒ± but currently, I am trying to dive deep into Rust. Sometimes I do some game prototyping with Unity and C#. Also, can do some Data Science with Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
Also, from time to time, I do standup comedy and write songs. But who cares about that on GitHub, right?

I am looking for any collaboration, but hey, I know that I need to become "more interesting" for that.
